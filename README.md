# CppSupplement
A guided walkthrough through some common trouble areas for introductory CS students at Portland State University.
Copyright Â© 2017 Andrew Waugh

## Overview
As a Technical Course Support Specialist at Portland State, I help teach and answer questions from students in the intro programming courses. Over time, I've noticed several common core concepts that students struggle with. This repository was designed as supplementry study material that I can point students to during busy office hours, self-study, or just as a practical, predictable example to work off of.

### Important Disclaimer
Though I work for the univeristy and for Karla Fant specifically, this is NOT an official Portland State resource. I have worked on this on my own time in the hopes that it will be useful for students and their learning. It is intended to be a tool for learning concepts only. *DO NOT* copy any code from this repository verbatim into an assignment. Doing so is plagarism and a violation of the PSU Academic Honesty policy which will result in severe penalties up to and including expulsion from the program. Do not copy passages of code and simply change the variable names either!

## Installation Instructions

### For Portland State Students
1. Use putty/cyberdeck or your ssh client of choice to connect to linux.cs.pdx.edu
1. Navigate to or create a directory that is convienent for you to store code repositories in. I reccomend something like ./Resources
    1. To create a directory, `mkdir Resources` in the root directory.
    1. Navigate into this directory by typing `cd ./Resources`. Remember that tab completion is your friend!
1. Clone this repository
    1. Type `git clone https://github.com/Zonr0/CppSupplement.git` into the command line and hit enter. Like all things in linux, this is case sensitive.
1. Navigate into the newly cloned directory by entering `cd ./CppSupplement`
1. Navigate into the course and topic of your choice.

### For Non-Portland State Students
More instructions here soon.
